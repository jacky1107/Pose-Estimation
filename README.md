author: Jacky Wang

All code is written in Python, if there is any question please feel free to ask.

# Introdution
In this project I consider the task of human activity recognition in realistic videos. Therefore, I made the videos that including dancing, walking and running in "dataSet" folder. Each activity has 2 videos and total is 6.

# Implementation

Please make sure you have installed these packages.

```
cv2
json
math
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
```

Run the program
```
python3 main.py
```

first thing I should do is extract the pose feature from videos which in the dataSet folder. Therefore, I use AlphaPose(https://github.com/Amanbhandula/AlphaPose) which is famous pose estimation repository
